# Domain Scan Script

This Jupyter Notebook is designed for scanning and analyzing various security aspects of a domain. The script performs the following key functions:

- **DNS Record Analysis**: Retrieves and analyzes DNS records, including A, MX, and TXT records.
- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Identifies and lists subdomains associated with the target domain.
- **Port Scanning**: Scans common ports to check for open or vulnerable ports.
- **SSL/TLS Analysis**: Checks the SSL/TLS configuration for potential weaknesses.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifies known vulnerabilities associated with the domain's services.

This tool is useful for security researchers and administrators looking to assess the security posture of a domain.
